Hey there! 👋

I'm Sky, an aspiring full-stack MERN developer from the Philippines.

I love building things and learning by creating real projects. If something sparks my curiosity, I’ll code it, debug it, and ship it.

My current tech stack is MongoDB, Express, React, and Node, and I’m always improving my frontend skills with modern tools and clean UI.

When I code, I always have music playing — it keeps me focused and in the zone.

I’m not super deep into fitness, but I do like working out and staying active when I can.

I’m also a huge anime fan — Dragon Ball is my all-time favorite. I read a lot of manga too, but lately manhwa has been taking over most of my free time.

Fun Facts:

I listen to music whenever I code

I love coffee

Favorite anime: Dragon Ball

Hobbies: anime, gym, manga/manhwa, coding
